# mood.exe
mood.exe is a cross-platform desktop app that prompts you to log your mood at regular intervals.

## how it works
-   auto launches at startup
-   prompts you to log your mood every 40 minutes (you can change this interval in the app settings)
-   choose between four moods
-   optionally add an entry about how you feel at that moment
-   everything is stored in a single JSON file located at `Documents/mood.json`

To sync your logs across devices, you can move the `mood.json` file to a folder synced by OneDrive, iCloud, or any other cloud service.
